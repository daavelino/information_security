## Command & control
>IN COMMAND AND OUT OF CONTROL\
The phrase “in command and out of control” perfectly describes the positioning approach you will see throughout this book. I originally read this
phrase in the book Blink, where Malcolm Gladwell tells the story of the leadership approach of U.S. General Paul Van Riper, who explained his military
strategy to his troops this way:
“The first thing I told my staff is that we would be in command and out of
control.”
By this he meant that the overall strategy and direction were so clear and well
understood that he was able to leave many of the decisions about how to
implement the strategy to others.
