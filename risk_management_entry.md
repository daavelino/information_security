# Risk entry for Vulnerability Management program
ISO definition of risk
>ISO/IEC 27000:2018 defines [risk](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27000:ed-5:v1:en:term:3.61) as following:
>3.61
>risk
>effect of uncertainty on objectives, with the following notes:
>-	Note 1 to entry: An effect is a deviation from the expected — positive or negative.
>-	Note 2 to entry: Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information related to, understanding or knowledge of, an event, its consequence, or likelihood.
>-	Note 3 to entry: Risk is often characterized by reference to potential “events” (as defined in ISO Guide 73:2009, 3.5.1.3) and “consequences” (as defined in ISO Guide 73:2009, 3.6.1.3), or a combination of these.
>-	Note 4 to entry: Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an event (including changes in circumstances) and the associated “likelihood” (as defined in ISO Guide 73:2009, 3.6.1.1) of occurrence.
>-	Note 5 to entry: In the context of information security management systems, information security risks can be expressed as effect of uncertainty on information security objectives.
>-	Note 6 to entry: Information security risk is associated with the potential that threats will exploit vulnerabilities of an information asset or group of information assets and thereby cause harm to an organization.

## Risk entry for a Vulnerability Management program
- Risk:
*The deviation from the business objectives caused by the exploitation of a system with vulnerable instructions or components.*

-	Rational:
*A code should be understood in this context as an abstract set of rules intended to instruct computers - or, when multiple computers are coordinated to perform a given task, a system - to perform a designated task that support the achievement of a business objective. If the instructions are incorrectly stated, there is not guarantee that the business objective will be achieved. If a specific set of instructions designed to prevent systems from deviate from their business objectives of confidentiality, integrity and availability is missing, one can say that the sytem is vulnerable and, for that, there is no guarantee that neither the business objectives nor the user needs can be satisfied as intended and, in some cases, some damage shall be considered as expected.*

-	Framing:

-	Business objective: *The instructions for all systems should produce the intended outcome in a not vulnerable way.*
